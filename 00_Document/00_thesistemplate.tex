%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% All of the above PDF/A standards have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Primarily to the PDF/A-1b standard. All the figures and graphs typically
%% use in thesis work do not require transparency features, a basic '2-D'
%% visualisation suffices. The font to be used are specified in this template
%% and they should not be changed. However, if you have figures where
%% transparency characteristics matter, use the PDF/A-2b standard. Do not use
%% the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, use jpg, png or pdf files. You may
%% have PDF/A compliance problems with figures in pdf format. Do not use PDF/A
%% compliant graphics files.
%% If you decide to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.

%% USE one of these:
%% * the first when using pdflatex, which directly typesets your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format and you want to publish your thesis online,

%% * the second when you want to print your thesis to bind it, or
%% * the third when producing a ps file and a pdf/a from it.

Your abstract in English. Keep the abstract short. The abstract explains your

written into the pdf file's metadata. Write here the text that goes into the 
metadata. The metadata cannot contain special characters, linebreak or paragraph 
break characters, so these must not be used here. If your abstract does not contain 
special characters and it does not require paragraphs, you may take advantage of 
the abstracttext macro (see the comment below). Otherwise, the metadata abstract 
text must be identical to the text on the abstract page.

%% work. Write here the copyright text you want. It is written into the metadata
%% of the pdf file as well.
%% Syntax:
%% \copyrigthtext{metadata text}{text visible on the page}
%% 
%% In the macro below, the text written in the metadata must have a \noexpand
%% macro before the \copyright special character, and macros (\copyright and
%% \year here) must be separated by the \ character (space chacter) from the
%% text that follows. The macros in the argument of the \copyrighttext macro
%% automatically insert the year and the author's name. (Note! \ThesisAuthor is
%% an internal macro of the aaltothesis.cls class file).
%% Of course, the same text could have simply been written as
%% \copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%% {Copyright \copyright{} 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%%
\copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ \number\year\ \ThesisAuthor}
{Copyright \copyright{} \number\year{} \ThesisAuthor}

%% You can prevent LaTeX from writing into the xmpdata file (it contains all the

  You can have special characters, linebreaks, and paragraphs here. Otherwise,

  If your abstract does not contain special characters and it does not require

\section{Background}

%% Three levels of hierarchy in sectioning should be enough

\subsection*{Numerointi}

Every section of the thesis begins on a new page. A subsection begins on a new 
page only if the previous page a full.

The page numbering begins from the cover page and it is continuous through to 
the end. Arabian numerals are in the page numbering.

The page numbers are made visibleafter the abstract pages, from the preface 
onwards, if there is one, or from the table of contents onwards.

The list of references (bibliography) begins on a new page.

Every appendix begins on a new page. Its page number continues from that on the
previous page.

The page number is place on the upper corner of the page.

%% The example for embedding the graphics file linediagram.pdf into the document.
%% Command \inclugraphics[parametres]{argument} embeds the graphic.
%% Command \centering centres the graphic on the page horizontally. 
%% Command \caption numbers and places the caption at the position of occurrence.
%% Parameters htb force the figure to the current place of occurrence in the
%% source file, if there is sufficient space, or places it to the top or bottom
%% of the page.

\section{Esimerkki liitteest\"a\label{LiiteA}}

Liitteet eiv\"at ole opinn\"aytteen kannalta v\"altt\"am\"att\"omi\"a ja 
opinn\"aytteen tekij\"an on 
kirjoittamaan ryhtyess\"a\"an hyv\"a ajatella p\"arj\"a\"av\"ans\"a ilman liitteit\"a.
Kokemattomat kirjoittajat, jotka ovat huolissaan
tekstiosan pituudesta, paisuttavat turhan 
helposti liitteit\"a pit\"a\"akseen tekstiosan pituuden annetuissa rajoissa.
T\"all\"a tavalla ei synny hyv\"a\"a opinn\"aytett\"a.   

Liite on itsen\"ainen kokonaisuus, vaikka se t\"aydent\"a\"akin tekstiosaa.
Liite ei siten ole pelkk\"a listaus, kuva tai taulukko, vaan 
liitteess\"a selitet\"a\"an aina sis\"all\"on laatu ja tarkoitus. 

Liitteeseen voi laittaa esimerkiksi listauksia. Alla on 
listausesimerkki t\"am\"an liitteen luomisesta. 

%% Verbatim-ymp\"arist\"o ei muotoile tai tavuta teksti\"a. Fontti on monospace.
%% Verbatim-ymp\"arist\"on sis\"all\"a annettuja komentoja ei LaTeX k\"asittele. 
%% Vasta \end{verbatim}-komennon j\"alkeen jatketaan k\"asittely\"a.
\begin{verbatim}
	\clearpage
	\appendix
	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Liite A}
	\section*{Liite A}
	...
	\thispagestyle{empty}
	...
	teksti\"a
	...
	\clearpage
\end{verbatim}

Kaavojen numerointi muodostaa liitteiss\"a oman kokonaisuutensa:
\begin{align}
d \wedge A &= F, \label{liitekaava1}\\
d \wedge F &= 0. \label{liitekaava2}
\end{align}


\clearpage
\section{Toinen esimerkki liitteest\"a\label{LiiteB}}

%% Liitteiden kaavat, taulukot ja kuvat numeroidaan omana kokonaisuutenaan
%%
%% Equations, tables and figures have their own numbering in Appendices
%\renewcommand{\theequation}{B\arabic{equation}}
%\setcounter{equation}{0}  
%\renewcommand{\thefigure}{B\arabic{figure}}
%\setcounter{figure}{0}
%\renewcommand{\thetable}{B\arabic{table}}
%\setcounter{table}{0}

Liitteiss\"a voi my\"os olla kuvia, jotka
eiv\"at sovi leip\"atekstin joukkoon:
%% Ymp\"arist\"on figure parametrit htb pakottavat
%% kuvan t\"ah\"an, eik\"a LaTeX yrit\"a siirrell\"a niit\"a
%% hyv\"aksi katsomaansa paikkaan. 
%% Ymp\"arist\"o\"a center voi k\"aytt\"a\"a \centering-
%% komennon sijaan
%%
%% Example of a figure, note the use of htb parameters which force
%% the figure to be inserted here

\end{center}
\caption{Kuvateksti, jossa on liitteen numerointi}
\label{liitekuva}
\end{figure}
%%
Liitteiden taulukoiden numerointi on kuvien ja kaavojen kaltainen:
\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{Taulukon kuvateksti.}
\label{liitetaulukko}
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\begin{tabular}{lp{0.5\linewidth}}
9.00--9.55  & K\"aytett\"avyystestauksen tiedotustilaisuus (osanottajat
ovat saaneet s\"ahk\"opostitse valmistautumisteht\"av\"at, joten tiedotustilaisuus
voidaan pit\"a\"a lyhyen\"a).\\
9.55--10.00 & Testausalueelle siirtyminen
\end{tabular}}
\end{center}
\end{table}
Kaavojen numerointi muodostaa liitteiss\"a oman kokonaisuutensa:
\begin{align}
T_{ik} &= -p g_{ik} + w u_i u_k + \tau_{ik},  \label{liitekaava3} \\
n_i    &= n u_i + v_i.                      \label{liitekaava4}
\end{align}
