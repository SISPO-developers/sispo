Currently, a problem exists with the `mathutils` import in the `sim.py`. An import of `bpy` must be done before running sispo.

Currently, the most extensive documentation on the project can be found in the `doc` folder. It contains the master thesis that was the starting point of this repository. The thesis is written in Latex and might need to be compiled.

Another kind of documentation is started using Read the Docs. It can be found by following the badge.
