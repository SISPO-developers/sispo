The study of \gls{sssb} provides a unique opportunity to understand the evaluation of the Solar System since they are unaltered remnants of the formation phase~\cite{walsh2018rubble, a2017comets}. Rapidly developing technology provides more opportunities to study such objects since interplanetary missions become feasible at a reasonable cost using small spacecraft (\cite{poghosyan2017cubesat}, \cite{andrews2019asteroid}, \cite{snodgrass2019europeanCI}).
In addition, asteroids are becoming interesting to companies -- numerous studies show that asteroid mining can become a viable business in the near future (\cite{andrews2015defining}, \cite{busch2004profitable}, \cite{weinzierl2018EconomicFrontier}, \cite{pittman2017deep}). Several companies, such as Planetary Resources \cite{lewicki2013planetary} or the Asteroid Mining Corporation Ltd. \cite{asteroidminingcorporation} were founded for creating an asteroid mining based business.

A total of \SI{3607}{} comets and \SI{931905}{} asteroids are known as of February 2020 \cite{nasaSBD_count}. Most knowledge about their size, shape and colour is inferred from ground based observations and space telescopes \cite{bowles2018castaway}. Approximately \SI{25}{} of such objects have been visited by spacecraft (\cite{wikipediaVisitedList}, \cite{nasaSBD_missions}). Considering the total of \SI{935512}{} known objects shows the potential number of remaining targets. Several missions to \gls{sssb} are planned. For example, the \textit{Comet Interceptor} mission by \gls{esa} \cite{snodgrass2019europeanCI}, the \textit{HERA} mission by \gls{esa} \cite{hera},  and the \textit{DART} mission by \gls{nasa} \cite{talbert_2017DART}. Closer studies through flyby or orbiting an \gls{sssb} provides more detailed information such as precise size and shape measurements as well as local variations in albedo for example.

Using small and low-cost spacecraft, it becomes possible not only to have more spacecraft to study \gls{sssb}s but also to fly closer to their nuclei, which is scientifically more interesting but associated with a higher risk of losing a spacecraft. This puts two major constraints onto their data budget. Their radio links provide lower data rates and the possibility of losing the spacecraft means transmitting the most important data first and complementing it later, if possible. A  common practice to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted is compression. Therefore it is necessary to investigate the effect of compression, especially on image data. In addition, an algorithm is necessary that can prioritise which data needs to be transmitted first and which can be transmitted later.

All these endeavours lead to an increased number of spacecraft that operate in deep space. Current operations and navigation of spacecraft in deep space relies on \gls{dsn}. Radio signals are used to determine a spacecraft's state vector through ranging and Doppler measurements \cite{ramamurthy2015delta}. Relying on such an infrastructure limits the number of spacecraft that can be operating in deep space. Additionally, this poses not only a risk to a mission due to reliance on a working ground segment, but is also associated with high costs. High costs are especially relevant to small spacecraft mission, since using a \gls{dsn} would increase the overall mission cost substantially \cite{steffes2017deep}. Furthermore, when a spacecraft is obstructed by the Sun, it is not possible to communicate with it and therefore not possible to use such techniques \cite{kominato2006optical}. Another problem with \gls{dsn}-based navigation become apparent with \textit{Comet Interceptor}, where high relative speeds do not allow for long delays associated with ground contacts in deep space. Similarly, with rendez-vous and landing missions to \gls{sssb}s, autonomous orbit determination is essential because mission events are happening too fast for relying on ground interaction \cite{shuang2013imageprocessing}. An alternative to using a \gls{dsn} are \gls{dsan} technologies. \gls{dsan} comprises trajectory and attitude determination only from on-board data and with on-board available computational power. In a next step, this information would be fed into an \gls{aocs} to correct pointing and trajectory errors. For example, optical navigation can be conducted on-board the spacecraft thus eliminating the requirement of ground contact. Optical navigation was already used in the \textit{Deep Space 1} mission cruise phase (\cite{Riedel2000AutonomousReport}, \cite{bhaskaran2012autonomous}). However, autonomous relative optical navigation in the proximity of a Solar System body will be essential for future deep space exploration and space mining economy (\cite{steffes2017deep}, \cite{martin2006jpl}, \cite{probst2016mission}). Hybrid optical navigation was used in the \textit{Hayabusa} mission in the proximity of the asteroid Itokawa. However, this method still relied on radiometric data from the ground segment \cite{kominato2006optical}. Therefore, fully autonomous navigation systems still need to be developed.

For developing navigation algorithms and methods to maximise scientific output, it is necessary to have images of \gls{sssb}s in order to test and validate these algorithms and methods. Although data sets from the \textit{OSIRIS} instrument aboard \textit{Rosetta} \cite{osirisArchive} or from the \textit{OSIRIS-REx}, \textit{Dawn} and \textit{NEAR} missions \cite{palmer2014small} are publicly available, the total number of images and their variation remains small.

Increased spacecraft autonomy around \gls{sssb}, maximising the science output and targeting unknown objects require images from a variety of differing objects to develop systems and algorithms. Since there is only a limited number of real images it is necessary to synthetically create images of \gls{sssb}s. Synthetically creating images of \gls{sssb}s is currently based on the parametric empirical models for directional reflectance properties of airless regolith surfaces, developed by Hapke \cite{hapke1981bidirectional, hapke1981bidirectional2, hapke1984bidirectional, hapke1986bidirectional, hapke2002bidirectional, hapke2008bidirectional, hapke2012bidirectional}. However, the Hapke model is also being challenged because it is an empirical, and not physical, model and because of its shortcomings in some areas \cite{shkuratov2012critical}. One of these areas are shadows, especially at slopes of e.g. craters \cite{shkuratov2012critical}. These are especially relevant to surface features of \gls{sssb}s. One possible solution is to use physics-based rendering with Path-tracing techniques (\cite{shkuratov2012critical}, \cite{lafortune1996mathematical}).

In this thesis, the first implementation of \gls{sispo} is developed. The aim was not to complete development of the software package but to provide a first draft. The implementation covers the entire processing pipeline from rendering and compression to reconstruction of a 3D model. These sub components are combined to form \gls{sispo}. To create realistic observation geometries, trajectories are simulated with proper orbital dynamics in the solar system.

The software package should provide a possibility to simulate different trajectories. Rendering should provide as realistic output as possible. Furthermore, it is necessary to include rendering of various \gls{sssb}s, including different size, shape and surface features. To assess the quality of rendered images and to investigate the impact of compression, it is posited that the quality recovered by an \gls{sfm} pipeline provides a quality measure in the form of the number of reconstructed points, number of vertices and number of faces. \gls{sispo} is being developed to provide these functionalities in a single software package.

%Advancing the field requires improving the statistics on the different types of \gls{sssb}s \cite{Pajusalu2019CharacterizationMapping}. Several new mission ideas are aiming for this goal. However, technological challenges have to be overcome first. Additionally, new mission concepts like the \gls{ci} mission require a new approach to model \gls{sssb}s. \gls{ci} is a mission that will investigate either a dynamically new comet from the Ã–pik-Oort cloud or an interstellar object. The mission will consist of a main spacecraft and two sub-spacecrafts that will be launched to the \gls{l2} and wait until a suitable \gls{sssb} will pass by. Consequently, the target body will not be known before launch hence systems have to be developed to deal with a large variety of bodies. However, only few \gls{sssb}s have been visited by spacecraft and thus only very limited real images are available. A method to deal with such sparse available data is to synthetically create images of \gls{sssb}s.


%This thesis focuses on image compression and decompression. These effects will be quantified using the reconstructed 3D models against the "ideal" model. A reference instrument definition similar to a suggested instrument for the 'Comet Interceptor' mission. Different compression and decompression algorithms will be evaluated using different \gls{sssb}s. Furthermore, different spacecraft trajectories will be examined to investigate limitations of the simulation environment.
