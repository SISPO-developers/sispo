\section{Theory} \label{sec:theory}
% Physics part
% - Composition (photometry) -> telescope optics?/instrument?
% - Trajectories and relative trajectory of spacecraft, especially trajectories for flybys
% - Star rendering?
% - Describe physics of SSSBs, i.e. size/shapes/surface (features/color/albedo) illumination
%
% Computer Science part
% - Physics-based rendering? -Shaders/procedural terrain generation
% - Compression
% - Reconstruction (SfM), relates to camera physics. Generally Computer Vision topic.
%
% Space
% - Small Spacecrafts -> small data budgets?
%
% Max Science?
% Navigation/autonomy?
