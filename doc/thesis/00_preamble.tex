%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% All of the above PDF/A standards have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Primarily to the PDF/A-1b standard. All the figures and graphs typically
%% use in thesis work do not require transparency features, a basic '2-D'
%% visualisation suffices. The font to be used are specified in this template
%% and they should not be changed. However, if you have figures where
%% transparency characteristics matter, use the PDF/A-2b standard. Do not use
%% the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, use jpg, png or pdf files. You may
%% have PDF/A compliance problems with figures in pdf format. Do not use PDF/A
%% compliant graphics files.
%% If you decide to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.

%% USE one of these:
%% * the first when using pdflatex, which directly typesets your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format and you want to publish your thesis online,

%% * the second when you want to print your thesis to bind it, or
%% * the third when producing a ps file and a pdf/a from it.

\thesisabstract{
Synthetic image generation and reconstruction of Small Solar System Bodies and the influence of compression is becoming an important study topic because of the advent of small spacecraft in deep space missions. Most of these missions are fly-by scenarios, for example in the Comet Interceptor mission. Due to limited data budgets of small satellite missions, maximising scientific return requires investigating effects of lossy compression. A preliminary simulation pipeline had been developed that uses physics-based rendering in combination with procedural terrain generation to overcome limitations of currently used methods for image rendering like the Hapke model. The rendered Small Solar System Body images are combined with a star background and photometrically calibrated to represent realistic imagery. Subsequently, a Structure-from-Motion pipeline reconstructs three-dimensional models from the rendered images. In this work, the preliminary simulation pipeline was developed further into the Space Imaging Simulator for Proximity Operations software package and a compression package was added. The compression package was used to investigate effects of lossy compression on reconstructed models and the possible amount of data reduction of lossy compression to lossless compression. Several scenarios with varying fly-by distances ranging from 50~km to~400 km and body sizes of 1~km and 10~km were simulated and compressed with lossless and several quality levels of lossy compression using PNG and JPEG~2000 respectively. It was found that low compression ratios introduce artefacts resembling random noise while high compression ratios remove surface features. The random noise artefacts introduced by low compression ratios frequently increased the number of vertices and faces of the reconstructed three-dimensional model.

% Your abstract in English. Keep the abstract short. The abstract explains your

% the abstracttext macro (see the comment below). Otherwise, the metadata abstract
